# Git-Pics-Scrapper

- ## [gitpics.py](https://github.com/chryz-hub/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/git-pics-scrapper/gitpics.py)
This is a python code that sends a request to GitHub user URL and parses the through the codes of that parses and prints out the URL of that GitHub user profile image.

## To get started please make sure you have these installed on your device
- PIP
PIP is a package manager for Python packages or modules, it is the standard package manager for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library.

<b> If you would love to watch a video on how pip is installed. [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko9b_vC6XY0)

You can check if you have it properly installed on your device by writing this code on your command terminal(CMD) `pip --version` If it shows the version of pip, example...something like this `pip 21.0.1 from c:\python\392\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.9)` might not necessary be like mine but something like this, then
you have it properly installed on your device but if it shows something like error, then it is not properly installed.

## After that, then you need to install these libraries
- `pip install requests`
- and `pip install bs4`

Without these the python code would not run the way it should!
