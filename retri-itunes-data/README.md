# Retrieve-Itunes-data
This code is to retrieve data from your itunes music; The artist, genre, music, length and so on like that, the codes are well commented for you to understand what it is all
about!

- ## [Tracks.py](https://github.com/chryz-hub/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/retri-itunes-data/tracks.py)
     The code is a pure python program, you run this on your terminal alone to get your itunes data
     
- ## [Tracksc.py](https://github.com/chryz-hub/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/retri-itunes-data/tracksc.py)
   This is a python code dealing with the storage of the data retrieved into an sqlite database. 

- ## [Itunesdata.xml](https://github.com/chryz-hub/py-projects/blob/master/all-python-codes/retri-itunes-data/itunesdata.xml)
    I later decided to commit an itunes music data(xml), it is an xml file and that would really work for any language you use. I made it available for use maybe probably you can get a personal data, you can make use of this!
